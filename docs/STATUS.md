**Swimming enclosure: engineering prototype under review; IP68 is not qualified.**

All authored repository/GitHub content is English. Original supplier reports retain
their original metadata.

Review: [updated two-page PDF](../mechanical/swim-r02-fit/review.pdf) and
[132-file bundle](../release/collar-tracker-r04i-swim-r02-fit-review.zip).
Bundle SHA256: `ea960e01f39e7b31aef930359a82b7b360e9e6c4a1fb232dad78c8d7f7032206`.
`python3 scripts/verify_handoff.py` verifies the saved PCB, mechanical checks and
every bundled file against the checkout; it performs no new supplier/physical test.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Outline / layers | 40 × 32 mm; four copper layers; 55 footprints |
| Native DRC/ERC/parity | Zero violations, warnings, opens or schematic mismatches |
| Ground | All 82 GND pads have local track paths to vias; 91 GND vias join both continuous inner planes |
| Return screen | All 93 non-GND vias within the inherited 2 mm screen; no inner-layer tracks |
| RF identity | All 24 baseline RF segments retained; impedance/body performance still unqualified |
| SIM access | All 19 other bottom-side bodies/lands clear the projected card lane, including 0.20 mm lateral margin |
| SIM topology | All four connector paths pass through their clamp land; no same-net copper bypass |
| JLC PCB DFM | Records `637245503244296194` and `637247002053398530`; 29 analyzed rows and 442 green measurements each |
| JLC rules | Unchanged SHA256 `f1bebb3b2b5ac2ba0579f882fc0605d169c1d6a3a852a07beb8652b719e0a725`; SMT off |

D1/C10 moved beside the card lane; D1 CLK/RST channels were exchanged in both
schematic and PCB. R12 moved to open a short protected reset crossing. The unused
old clock branch was removed. R12's two copper attachments are both 0.2 mm.
The first supplier run found 5 Danger / 2 Warning at the SIM legend; moving that
legend 1.476 mm resolved them. The failed package/report is preserved separately.
A later browser attempt never uploaded a file and is not counted as an analysis.
The helper now detects that condition instead of returning apparent success.

All final evidence is indexed in the trial's `evidence/routing-checkpoint.json`.
Preserve the tested bytes. Any later PCB change needs a new package and fresh checks.

## Active mechanical work

The user selected swimming / an IP68 design target. The provisional condition is
2 m fresh water for 60 minutes; depth/time and magnetic charging remain engineering
assumptions pending the user's preference replies.

`mechanical/swim-r02-fit/` is the active populated-board fit revision. It retains
the shell, lid, lift-out carrier, independently sealed charging targets, magnet
plugs, dock alignment shell and required TPU boot. Rigid size remains
57.4 × 49.4 × 17.6 mm, 58.7 mm including the key; boot 60.4 × 52.4 × 22.4 mm.

The actual native placements now have 49 drawing-derived component-height
envelopes, two factory wire-termination requirements and two bare test-pad areas;
C11/C12 remain DNP. Maximum height including solder/warp allowances is 2.75 mm
above and 1.75 mm below the board. All 53 entries pass the declared fit screen;
the narrowest component gap is C10 to the carrier, 0.24 mm against a 0.20 mm target.
These are dimensional screens, not component or PCBA purchasing approval.

D1's tolerance envelope required a local carrier relief. The original M4 backing
hardware envelope failed floor/board clearance; r02 uses a dimensional M3 thin-nut
candidate, a 3.5 mm M3 × 0.5 contact thread and Z=5.5 mm contact centers. Two shallow
carrier reliefs clear the backing stack while retaining 1 mm connecting bridges.
The terminal/washer stack is still a constrained reservation, not a selected harness.

Six regressions pass, including the original interference cases and an oversized
J4 wire termination. An independent CAD boolean is empty for the revised geometry
and nonempty when the original carrier is restored. All eight exported meshes
are closed, oriented and connected; four previews and both review sheets were
inspected. The 30 inherited shell/seal checks also pass. r01 and its bundle remain
byte-preserved.

This is a **prototype, not a completed production design**. The
[selection review](../mechanical/swim-r02-fit/selection-review.md) explains why the
researched protected packs and antennas are not yet released: size alone does not
prove modem pulse capability or RF performance. The 30 × 5 mm antenna rectangles
still represent reservations. Dock electronics, harness routing/strain relief,
positive PCB retention, material/seal grades, actual lid fasteners and torque remain
open. No physical ingress, powered or RF result exists.

Next: select the actual protected NTC pack and LTE/GNSS antennas, fit their
feeds/cables and clearances, then finish the dock/harness and retention details.
Before tooling or full PCBA release, complete actual
assembly/RF/power review and whole-assembly dust/immersion testing. Türkiye operator
service and moving-animal coverage remain open. Factory assembly/programming/test
is still required; no end-user soldering is intended.

## Preserved checkpoints

0.3.4 and r04g retain their original native files and two supplier reports.
r04h is the last pre-access-repair source; its clean DRC did not establish card
insertion clearance. None of those earlier supplier results is reused for r04i.
Local rejected routing trials stay in ignored working evidence.

Nano-SIM now, eSIM later. J5 is a digital expansion port, not a heart-rate sensor.
No order, payment, supplier message, powered test or production approval occurred.
